# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! This document outlines the steps for building the solution from scratch, submitting code
contributions, and making releases.

## Development Workflow

Our development workflow follows these steps:

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make your changes locally
3. Run checks locally
4. Commit & push your changes
5. Wait for the remote checks to pass
6. Squash & merge

## Building Locally

To build the solution locally, we provide a PowerShell script:

```powershell
.\src\BuildForRelease.ps1
```

This script will install all necessary dependencies before building. If you prefer to build only parts of the solution, please inspect the script for specific
commands.

## Packaging for Release Locally

After building the solution, you can create local release bundles (compressed as zip archives) with the following script:

```powershell
.\src\PackageForRelease.ps1
```

Please note that these local release bundles are meant for testing purposes only. Our continuous integration system on GitHub automatically builds, packages,
and publishes official releases.

## Local Pre-commit Checks

To ensure code quality (e.g., consistent code formatting), we run several checks. GitHub will automatically run these checks on every push, but itâ€™s faster to
run them locally first during development.

### Formatting Code

Format your code with the following script:

```powershell
.\src\FormatCode.ps1
```

### Running Checks

Run the checks with:

```powershell
.\src\Check.ps1
```

## Submitting Your Code

### Branching

**If you are part of the `Eclipse AASX Package Explorer and Server`GitHub organization:**
Create a branch prefixed with your GitHub username using dashes to describe the change (e.g., `mristin/Add-a-shiny-new-feature-B`).

**Otherwise:** If you are not a member of the organization, you need to fork the repository and create your feature branch on the fork. 
See the [GitHub documentation about forking][github-fork].

[github-fork]: https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo

### Commit and Pull Request

Commit your local changes and push them to the remote repository. Ensure your commit message adheres to the guidelines outlined at 
[Chris Beams' Git Commit Guidelines](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):

* Separate subject from body with a blank line.
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
* Capitalize the subject line.
* Do not end the subject line with a period.
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
* Wrap the body at 72 characters.
* Use the body to explain what and why (instead of how).

You can use special hints in the commit messages to disable checks or the building of a Docker image:

* `The workflow build-and-publish-docker-images was intentionally skipped.` (No Docker images will be created)
* `The workflow check-release was intentionally skipped.` (No release check, particularly no build)
* `The workflow check-style was intentionally skipped.` (No checks for code style)

#### Example Commit Message

```
Add a shiny new feature B

Previously, the solution could not perform A, and it was confusing for
the users how to use `SomeModule`. This change introduces a
new feature B, which solves A as well as the problem with C.

This is important because D now runs much faster and has a clearer 
structure. Moreover, feature B is particularly practical for use cases 
such as E and F.
 
Finally, we update the documentation to reflect how to manage G
in these concrete use cases E and F.

The workflow build-and-publish-docker-images was intentionally skipped.
```

Once all checks pass, push your commit and create a pull request. Refer to [GitHub's documentation about pull requests][pull-request] for guidance.

### Merging

We typically squash and merge pull requests into our 'main' branch.

### Releasing

We publish new versions using [GitHub Releases][release] via the web browser. The workflow `./github/workflows/build-and-package-release.yml` will 
automatically build, package, and attach the release bundles to the GitHub release.

### Appendix: GitHub Workflows

We use [GitHub Workflows][workflows] to automate tasks such as pre-commit checks, building, packaging, publishing release bundles, and building and 
publishing Docker images for demonstration.

Please see the `./.github/workflows` directory for the source code of our workflows.
